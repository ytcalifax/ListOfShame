## The List™
A non-exhaustive list of projects, websites and other things that are known to have rather... unpleasant vibes.

### [Yatopia] and [SugarcaneMC]
> *The Combined power of paper forks and patches for maximum instability and maintainability!*

Messy, tossed salad of people that haven't even really understood the patch system. And yes, *it's [that bad](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia)!*

### [Mohist]
> *Mohist is programmed to be malicious, game-breaking, and very unstable.*

Mohist tricks users into deleting official plugin jars and [installing unofficial modified builds](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html).

### Bukkit, CraftBukkit and Spigot
> *Extremely outdated in terms of performance compared to other server software you have access to.*

### [WorldQL]
> *Run a server with thousands of players with a software that is not designed for this.*

Interesting project with a promising idea, but with Sugarcane-level advertising, vastly blown out of proportion, and already containing countless red flags in their public Spigot plugin, which do not give the impression of scalability.

### [SkinsRestorer]
> `try {} catch (Exception e) {}` *Who needs to know about errors anyway?*

The most bukkit-like code you can think of coming from one-time contributors.

### [EntityTrackerFixer]
> *Let's fix entities by disabling tracking them completely! Who needs this anyway? ;^)*

Paper already implements most of its fixes anyway...

### Any (paid) closed-source 1.8 PaperMC Fork available on MCMarket... Ever.
> *"Optimized", "Cannons", "Multithreaded" (The quotes are intentional)*

Mostly just copied off each other with little to no actual work involved or improvements done, with many even introducing major bugs or including security breaches.

### [Kangarko]
> *Learn how to get hated by everyone in record-time through shady advertising and privacy violations!*

It's not like free Java courses such as [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) exist...  
Also, uses e-mails from other sources [to advertise his course](https://www.andre601.ch/blog/posts/2020/12-20-in-defense-of-spigotmc/#point-2-abusing-knowledgedata) and lists plugin-reviews as "rating" for his courses.

Also, also blames everyone else for problems he faces. The latest confirmed victim of this: The entirety of [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/478408/).

### [Yooniks]
> *The embodiment of MCM*

If you feel like you have too much money and you are looking for horrible, closed-source forks of Bungee/Spigot, Yooniks is your guy. He's so good that even MCM banned him for being an ass.

### [ClearLagg]
> *Use one of ClearLagg's many utilities to cause more lag*

Causes more lag than it removes and doesn't even know its own name.

### [CMI]
> *Over 280 must-have bugs for your Server*

The perfect solution for everyone who is alergic against well established (free!) plugins like EssentialsX and think that "paid = good".

### [Songoda]
> *The one-stop sketchy marketplace for Minecraft plugins*

It can't get more sketchy than Songoda.  
Got banned from Spigot and also from PayPal, than started to blame PayPal for "banning selling of MC plugins" and finally sells plugins through Patreon subscriptions.  
(Also owns "ServerJars" which is a Mojang ToS breaking site by distributing build modified Server jars... Just so you know.)

### [NeruxVace]
> *Money ain't got wings!*

Minigames network that won't let anything stand in the way of its urge for "success". Whether it's paying developers, or simply following up on (legal-)agreements - Noah Kemm doesn't need any of that!

### [Mortal Mines]
> *A """"unique"""" prison server... Not*

Network that mass DM bots discord servers to gain players for a pay2win prison server. Alexander Didio (aka LizardZ or Energy) has owned and killed OPMines, Sparkverse, WickedSkies, FrostyMC, and Jurassic Mines after two months once their playerbase has been milked dry.

### Minecraft 1.8
> *An outdated version of Minecraft with more security issues than features!*

Hasn't been updated since 2015 (6+ YEARS![^mc18])

### Minecraft 1.7.10
> *An outdated version of Minecraft with even more, high-severity security issues than features!*

Hasn't been updated since 2014 (7+ YEARS![^mc1710])

### [ViaVersion]
> *1.8 - 1.17 KitPvP*

Enables [**the evil**](#minecraft-1-8) to continue to live.

### [ProtocolSupport]
> *Like ViaBackwards but with more **evil***

### [Slimefun]
> *It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From taking 70% of your tick to clearing inventories at random!*

Tries to turn your server in an FTB modpack... **tries to**.

### [FastAsyncWorldEdit]
> *Async = Better!!1!i!one!*

The fastest WorldEdit alternative in terms of breaking things.

### [AsyncWorldEdit]
> *Async = Better!!1!i!one!... I get a sense of deja-vu...*

Just like [FAWE](#fastasyncworldedit) but slower AND breaks the WorldEdit license on top of that!

### [IllegalStack]
> *Dupe & Exploit "fixer"*

Actually introduces dupes, eats 15% of your ticks, and likes to do wonky things like removing nametags of players and entities.

### [EpicWorldGenerator]
> *Get the most laggy world generation you can buy for money.*

It sure is worth paying $20 (originally $40) that offers the same as dozens of free alternatives.  
Also, actually uses code stolen from other free resources[^ewg-code] (Realistic World Gen[^rwg])

### [PM2]
> *Update your plugin 500 times with single additions and fixes!*

Updates sure aren't published that frequently to bump the resource and reviews... right? (Not to get confused with pm2 Process Manager[^pm2-pm])

### [SunLight]
> *Advanced server management plugin with all the plugin-breaking bugs your server needs!*

It takes RGB chat formatting to a whole other level, parsing hex codes in other plugins' commands. When the author was asked about it, they said that the only way around it is to [use their library to convert them back][sunlight-comment].

### [Mohist]
> *Combine the most incompatible things - Bukkit and Forge - and create an abomination!*

They swap EssentialsX's plugin jar with their own[^mohist-swap] after trying to submit a PR[^essentialsx-pr] to fix their own butchering of the Bukkit API.  
*Then* tried to turn EssentialsX's PSA[^essentialsx-psa] regarding security concerns in Mohist into an ad[^mohist-ad].

### [The Duper Trooper]
> *Exploiting bugs is fine and won't get you banned from servers /s*

Clickbait YouTube channel that "leaks" exploits and other security related issues to the public and encourages its followers to report to them instead of disclosing properly.  
And yes, [they actually do][trooper-report].

## Software Alternatives and Info threads
This is the only section of this list you should *actually* take somewhat seriously.

### Optimized all-in-one servers
PaperMC, Airplane, Purpur.  
Most stable and performant will most likely be PaperMC.

### "Hybrid" Servers (Forge/anything else + Bukkit)
Read the PSA from EssentialsX[^essentialsx-psa] for actual good alternatives (and reasons why hybrid-servers are bad).

### Anti-Lag solutions
Read [this guide on Server optimization][server-optimization] and [this answer to it][server-optimization-answer] for setup and info.

### Dupe fixers
Use PaperMC (or one of its **sane** forks) and stay on the latest Minecraft version. Unless you run a Creative server, then plugins to remove data-spammed items makes sense.

### EWG info and alternatives
Read [this reddit post][ewg-code].

### SkinsRestorer alternatives
For the love of god **don't run your server/network in offline mode!**

### CMI alternative
EssentialsX. Free, open source and you're more likely to get a bug fixed much faster.

## Disclaimer
This list is NOT a "You must not use/do XYZ" kind of thing. It's just to point out stuff that some people find *questionable* in terms of design choice, code, etc.  
Take it lightly and PR any corrections of plain wrong information.  
Have a nice day!
